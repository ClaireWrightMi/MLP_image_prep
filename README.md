## Intructions for Running

### STEP 1 : Download the code
1. Press the green button that says Code and select download as zip.
2. Unzip the folder and move to the location of choice (usually better to keep it on the local drive rather than anywhere on the cloud)
3. Keep the name MLP_img_prep for the folder (and make sure itâ€™s not nested)

### STEP 2: Install Python
1. Check whether Python is installed (instructions [here] (https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-install-python))
2. If Python is not installed, install it from the Python website (instructions [here](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-install-python))


### STEP 3: Set Up Virtual Environment
*The virtual environment will allow you to install Python libraries without risking conflict with other projects.*
1. Open File Explorer or Finder and navigate to the folder with your code.
2. Open Command Line or Terminal (from start, type Command Line for Windows or Terminal for Mac and open the first result)
3. Type the following:
	
	Windows:
	```console
	py -m venv MLP_img_prep
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	python3 -m venv MLP_img_prep
	```

### STEP 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
1. Open Command Line or Terminal (from start, type Command Line for Windows or Terminal for Mac and open the first result)
2. Type the following using the name of the folder holding the code
	
	Windows:
	```console
	MLP_img_prep\Scripts\activate
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	source MLP_img_prep/bin/activate
	```

Your command prompt should now have the name of your folder in brackets before the cursor.


### STEP 5: Install Dependencies
1. Upgrade pip (type the following in command line)
	
	Windows:
	```console
	py -m pip install --upgrade pip
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	Python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
	```

2. Install numpy

	Windows:
	```console
	py -m pip install numpy
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	Python3 -m pip install numpy
	```

3. Install pillow

	Windows:
	```console
	py -m pip install pillow
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	Python3 -m pip install pillow
	```

4. Install tkinter

	Windows:
	```console
	py -m pip install tkinter
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	Python3 -m pip install tkinter
	```

### STEP 6: Set up the image folder
1. Download all images from Explorer
2. Edit in Affinity Photo
3. Store all images from **one station** in a folder, each station should have its own folder
4. Images should be named to correspond to their name in Explorer (e-copy number is best)

### STEP 7: Run the program

**MAKE SURE YOUR ENVIRONMENT IS ACTIVE BEFORE DOING THIS, IF NOT, RETURN TO STEP 4.**

1. In the command line, navigate to the directory for the code (notice the different slashes on Windows vs Mac)

	Windows:
	```console
	cd C:\Folder\Folder\MLP_img_prep
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	cd /Folder/Folder/MLP_img_prep
	```

	a. To find the path on Windows, navigate to the file in File Explore, right click, choose properties, and check the File location under details

	b. To find the path on Mac, navigate to the file in Finder, right click, choose Get Info, and check Where

2. Run the script

	Windows:
	```console
	py MLP_image_prep.py
	```
	Mac:
	```console
	Python3 MLP_image_prep.py
	```

3. A window will pop up: Navigate to the folder containing your images
4. After a minute, a second window will pop up: Navigate to the folder where you want to save the completed PDF
